        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Security Disclosure: This platform is designed with a "Local-First" architecture. All financial data is
                processed directly in your browser's memory and is never transmitted to or stored on our servers.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to data minimization. We collect only what is necessary to provide a high-quality ETL
            service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous analytics (pages visited, time spent) to improve the engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Bank statements and CSVs are processed <strong>in-memory</strong> in
                your browser. They are not stored on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Info:</strong> For Pro users, we store your email and conversion metadata (count, date)
                for your personal history log.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use specific professional services to maintain the platform:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For secure user authentication and account metadata storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe / Lemon Squeezy:</strong> For secure payment processing. We do not store credit card
                details.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics & AdSense:</strong> We use Google services to understand platform performance
                and display relevant advertisements. Google uses cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to
                your website or other websites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Google AdSense & Cookies</h2>
        <p>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their
            visit to QC and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a
                href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Ads Settings</a>.</p>
        <p>Third-party vendors and ad networks may also be serving ads on our site. You can opt-out of some third-party
            vendors' uses of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting <a
                href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Protection Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
        <p>Regardless of your location, we honor your right to privacy. Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and
            California (USA) have specific rights regarding their personal data, including the right to access, rectify,
            or erase the data we collect.</p>

        <h2>3. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS) for all communications. Our deterministic pipeline is designed to
            be ephemeral—data exists only during the transformation process and is cleared upon refresh.</p>

        <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, export, or delete your conversion history and account data at any time through
            the dashboard or by contacting support.</p>
