        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Security Disclosure: This platform is designed with a "Local-First" architecture. All financial data is
                processed directly in your browser's memory and is never transmitted to or stored on our servers.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to data minimization. We collect only what is necessary to provide a high-quality ETL
            service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous analytics (pages visited, time spent) to improve the engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Bank statements and CSVs are processed <strong>in-memory</strong> in
                your browser. They are not stored on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Info:</strong> For Pro users, we store your email and conversion metadata (count, date)
                for your personal history log.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use specific professional services to maintain the platform:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For secure user authentication and account metadata storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Stripe / Lemon Squeezy:</strong> For secure payment processing. We do not store credit card
                details.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To understand platform performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS) for all communications. Our deterministic pipeline is designed to
            be ephemeral—data exists only during the transformation process and is cleared upon refresh.</p>

        <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, export, or delete your conversion history and account data at any time through
            the dashboard or by contacting support.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
