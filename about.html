        <h1>About QuickConvert (QC)</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Mission: Bridging the gap between heterogeneous bank data and standardized accounting
            schemas.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>QuickConvert was born out of a simple observation: auditors and financial analysts spend too much time
                manually re-formatting bank statements. Our goal is to automate this "ETL" (Extract, Transform, Load)
                process while maintaining absolute data privacy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Our Core Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We believe that your financial data should never leave your control. Unlike many online converters that
            upload your sensitive documents to a cloud server for processing, QC uses a
            <strong>Secure-by-Design</strong> architecture where the heavy lifting happens locally in your browser.</p>

        <h2>The Deterministic Engine</h2>
        <p>Our extraction logic isn't based on "best guesses." We use a deterministic engine that understands the
            underlying structures of bank statements from the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and many other global markets.
            This ensures that debits, credits, and balances are reconciled with mathematical precision.</p>

        <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>External Auditors:</strong> Streamlining the creation of ledgers for year-end reviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Fractional CFOs:</strong> Quickly normalizing data from multiple bank accounts for consolidated
                reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>Accounting Teams:</strong> Automation of monthly bank reconciliation tasks without the risk of
                cloud data exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Developers & Analysts:</strong> Converting disparate PDF and CSV exports into clean, audit-ready
                Excel documents for further processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transparency & Trust</h2>
        <p>We are committed to the highest standards of transparency. Our billing is clear, our privacy policy is
            explicit about data at rest (there is none), and our team is continuously refining our algorithms to support
            more institutions globally.</p>
